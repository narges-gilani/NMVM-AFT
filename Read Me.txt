#'@param{

#' @y~ denotes the response vector, which may be right-censored or left-censored

#' @x~ A matrix or vector of explanatory (predictor) variables.

#' @Family~  Distribution to be used: "Normal", "VG","GHST", "NMVBS", "H", "NMVL", "AL".

#' @cens~ "Left" for left-censoring, "Right" for right-censoring.

#' @cc~ Censoring indicator vector: 1= observed, 0= censored.

#' @influence~ "TRUE" or "FALSE". Indicates if the divergence measures (KL divergence, J, L and Chi Distance) should be computed.

#' @spacing~ The 'spacing' parameter should only be set when either 'influence' or 'criteria' is TRUE,
#'  defining the lag between retained post-burn-in/thinning samples used for computation (spacing=1 uses all samples)."

#' @criteria~ "TRUE" or "FALSE". Indicates if model selection
#' criteria (LPML, DIC, EAIC, EBIC and WAIC) should be computed.

#' @influence~ "TRUE" or "FALSE". Indicates if the divergence measures
#' (KL divergence, J, L and Chi Distance) should be computed.

#'  @hyper_set~ enables assigning new values to the model's hyperparameters.

#'  @prior~ Possible prior distributions that may be considered for parameter nu include:
#'    "Exp" (exponential distribution), "Unif"(Uniforme distribution), and "Hierar_1" (Hierarchical prior distribution).
 
#'   @hyper~ Value of hyperparameter for the exponential prior.
 
#' @n.thin~ Lag for posterior sample thta reduces autocorrelation between MCMC samples by retaining every nth iteration.
                               
#' @burnin~ Burn-in phase in Bayesian MCMC discards initial samples to ensure convergence before analysis.

#' @n.iter~ The number of iterations to be considered (before burnin and thinning).
 
#' @n.chains~ The number of chains to be considered.
 
#' @sample.out~ If "TRUE", all the posterior chains are stored for posterior analysis.

#'  @level~  indicates the percentage of censorship.
